## My process

- Built a semantic layout using `main` and an `article` card with the QR image, heading, and description.
- Centered the card with Flexbox and full‑viewport height for clean alignment.
- Styled with the Outfit font, a white card, rounded corners, and a subtle shadow using the provided palette.
- Made the QR image responsive and kept typography readable with spacing and alignment.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

- How to structure a simple component with semantic HTML (`main`, `article`, headings, and paragraphs).
- When to use semantic containers versus plain `div` wrappers.
- How to publish a project to GitHub from VS Code and from the terminal.
- Basic terminal workflow for Git (init, add, commit, and push) and how to paste commands depending on the terminal.

### Continued development

- Improve responsive layouts (spacing, typography, and scaling on smaller screens).
- Practice using semantic HTML and accessibility checks by default.
- Build more confidence with Git and GitHub workflows from the terminal.
